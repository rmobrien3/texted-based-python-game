Reilly O'Brien
Text based fighting game with some hidden features
Tested by running through each prompt multiple times selecting different weapons each time. Was going to try and make it simple but code creep kicked in and I decided to add some easter eggs to the code from an anime. 

For some reason, github hates me and I had to run it in an online python compliler to verify it works. Github is currently giving me a invalid syntax line 1 error 

The new python concept I learned/explored was the random modifier. I learned that the random modifier/module helps with picking in this example, random enemies and random weapons the enemies use. 

as far as challenges, I keep forgetting to put : at the end mostly, I ended up having to take a few breaks and look over the code with fresh eyes to see the errors I made. 

I also overcame the challenges of this code by googling examples of adding trigger type events/how to add random modifiers to code to get a better understanding.
